# FastAPI Learning Project

## This repository is a learning artifact and is not presented as a production-ready or original product.

This repository contains a full-stack FastAPI application implemented for the purpose of learning FastAPI concepts such as authentication, async routes, dependency injection, and request validation.

The structure and flow follow a guided tutorial, but the code was written manually to understand real-world FastAPI application design patterns and best practices.
