# FastAPI Application (Learning Sandbox)

*This repository documents my journey learning FastAPI to build production-grade Machine Learning APIs.*

> **Note:** This project follows the architecture and best practices from Cory Schafer's FastAPI curriculum. I have implemented the code manually to build muscle memory in:
> * **Authentication** (OAuth2 with Password Hashing)
> * **Pydantic Models** (Data Validation)
> * **SQLAlchemy** (ORM & Database Relations)
> * **Async/Await** patterns

**Purpose:** This is a learning artifact. My goal is to apply these backend skills to deploy my future End-to-End Deep Learning projects.
